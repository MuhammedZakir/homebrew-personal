# MuhammedZakir Personal

## WARNING: I use this tap for adding `HEAD` url and also a few options. Because I install from source, bottle and tar files probably will be outdated. So this tap will be useful ONLY if you are installing development/HEAD version.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install muhammedzakir/personal/<formula>`

Or `brew tap muhammedzakir/personal` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MuhammedZakir/homebrew-personal/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
